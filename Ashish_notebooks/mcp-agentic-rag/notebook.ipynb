    "faq_text = \"\"\"Question 1: What is the first step before building a machine learning model?\n",
    "Answer 1: Understand the problem, define the objective, and identify the right metrics for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: How important is data cleaning in ML?\n",
    "Answer 2: Extremely important. Clean data improves model performance and reduces the chance of misleading results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Should I normalize or standardize my data?\n",
    "Answer 3: Yes, especially for models sensitive to feature scales like SVMs, KNN, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: When should I use feature engineering?\n",
    "Answer 4: Always consider it. Well-crafted features often yield better results than complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: How to handle missing values?\n",
    "Answer 5: Use imputation techniques like mean/median imputation, or model-based imputation depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 6: Should I balance my dataset for classification tasks?\n",
    "Answer 6: Yes, especially if the classes are imbalanced. Techniques include resampling, SMOTE, and class-weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 7: How do I select features for my model?\n",
    "Answer 7: Use domain knowledge, correlation analysis, or techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination or SHAP values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 8: Is it good to use all features available?\n",
    "Answer 8: Not always. Irrelevant or redundant features can reduce performance and increase overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 9: How do I avoid overfitting?\n",
    "Answer 9: Use techniques like cross-validation, regularization, pruning (for trees), and dropout (for neural nets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 10: Why is cross-validation important?\n",
    "Answer 10: It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance by reducing bias from a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 11: What’s a good train-test split ratio?\n",
    "Answer 11: Common ratios are 80/20 or 70/30, but use cross-validation for more robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 12: Should I tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "Answer 12: Yes. Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 13: What’s the difference between training and validation sets?\n",
    "Answer 13: Training set trains the model, validation set tunes hyperparameters, and test set evaluates final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 14: How do I know if my model is underfitting?\n",
    "Answer 14: It performs poorly on both training and test sets, indicating it hasn’t learned patterns well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 15: What are signs of overfitting?\n",
    "Answer 15: High accuracy on training data but poor generalization to test or validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 16: Is ensemble modeling useful?\n",
    "Answer 16: Yes. Ensembles like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting often outperform individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 17: When should I use deep learning?\n",
    "Answer 17: Use it when you have large datasets, complex patterns, or tasks like image and text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 18: What is data leakage and how to avoid it?\n",
    "Answer 18: Data leakage is using future or target-related information during training. Avoid by carefully splitting and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 19: How do I measure model performance?\n",
    "Answer 19: Choose appropriate metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 20: Why is model interpretability important?\n",
    "Answer 20: It builds trust, helps debug, and ensures compliance—especially important in high-stakes domains like healthcare.\n",
